;; RSpec (minor) mode
;; ==================
;;
;; This minor mode provides some minor enhancements to ruby-mode in
;; the contexts of RSpec specifications.  Namely, it provides the
;; following capabilities:
;;
;;  * toggle back and forth between a spec and it's target (bound to
;;    `\C-c so`)
;;
;;  * verify the spec file associated with the current buffer (bound to `\C-c ,`)
;;  
;;  * verify the spec defined in the current buffer if it is a spec
;;    file (bound to `\C-c ,`)
;;
;;  * ability to disable the example at the point (bound to `\C-c sd)
;;
;;  * ability to reenable the disabled example at the point (bound to
;;    `\C-c se
;;
;;
;; Known Issues
;; ------------
;;
;; Disable/reenable example miss parts of the current example some time.
