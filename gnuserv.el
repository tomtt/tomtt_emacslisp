; Updated for XEmacs, GNU Emacs 19 and Epoch V4 to use multiple frames
; by Bob Weiner, <weiner@mot.com>, 1/20/94.  (Still works with Emacs V18, too.)
;    Modified 'server-process-filter' to use \^D as end of request terminator
;      as gnuclient and gnudoit have been modified to send.  This permits
;      multi-line requests.
;    Modified 'server-make-window-visible' to work with multiple frames.
;    Modified 'server-find-file' to display in a separate frame when possible.
;    Modified 'server-edit' to delete newly created frame when used to
;      terminate an edit and to signal an error if called within a
;      non-server-edit buffer.
; Bob Weiner, <weiner@mot.com>, 5/9/94.
;    Added 'server-done-function' variable.  Made default value 'kill-buffer'
;    instead of 'bury-buffer' as in original gnuserv.el.
;
; Darrell Kindred <dkindred+@cmu.edu> May/1994
; Updated to allow multi-line return values:
;    - output to gnuserv is "m/n:xxx" where m is the client number,
;      n is the length of the data, and xxx is the data itself, followed 
;      by newline
;
; Arup Mukherjee <arup+@cmu.edu> May/1994
; Updated for XEmacs 19.10, and others:
;    - use find-file-other-screen if present
;    - new variable gnuserv-frame can be set to a frame or screen which is 
;      is used for all edited files. 
;    - check to see if server.el is already loaded and complain if it is, since
;      gnuserv.el can't coexist with server.el
;    - rename server-start to gnuserv-start, although server-start remains as
;      an alias. This allows gnuserv-start to be autoloaded from gnuserv.el
;    - changed server-get-buffer to take into account that in newer emacsen,
;      get buffer returns nil on deleted buffers.
;    - only try to create/delete frames or screens if window-system is non-nil 
;      (otherwise things don't work w/ emacs19 on a dumb terminal)
;
