2007-07-21  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* README: Mention that Muse 3.03 or later is needed.

	* planner-authz.el, planner-timeclock.el, planner-calendar.el,
	planner-publish.el: Remove support for old markup-tag syntax, now
	that Muse 3.03 is released.

	* planner-calendar.el (planner-calendar-prev-month-href)
	(planner-calendar-next-month-href): Don't escape specials specials
	in the URL description.  This should fix a bug with "&laquo;" and
	"&raquo;".

	* planner-publish.el: Error out when loading if we have Muse less
	than 3.03.  Also, remove `unless' wrapper around uses of
	muse-derive-style.
	(planner-publish-ignore-url-desc-specials): New variable that
	determines whether to ignore specials in URL descriptions.
	(planner-publish-decide-specials): New function that uses this
	variable.
	("planner-xml", "planner-xhtml", "planner-xhtml"): Set :specials
	to planner-publish-decide-specials.

	* planner-el.texi: Replace "www.mwolson.org" with "mwolson.org"
	for brevity.

2007-07-03  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

2007-06-17  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	of planner-publish, rather than muse-html.

2007-05-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-el.texi (Installing from Arch): Update Archzoom URL.

2007-05-07  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* README: Mention that there are multiple mailing lists.

	* planner-el.texi (Getting Help): Add entry for the new log
	messages list.

	* planner-publish.el: Fix bug in publishing of calendars.  The

	inserted, which was incorrect.

2007-04-09  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* README: Use new link to online documentation.

2007-04-08  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	C-t, closes #8361.

	* planner-el.texi (Preface): Use John's on-line documentation for
	Planner, rather than mine.

2007-04-02  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (Planning based on the Franklin-Covey Approach):
	Correct MixedCase instructions, closes #8357. Other minor fixups

2007-03-04  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	we're compatible with.

2007-02-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner.el (planner-setup-highlighting): Use quote instead of
	backquote.  This should hopefully fix a weird error with ntemacs
	23.0.0.1.

2007-02-06  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (Task Detail): Clarification, see #8366.
	(Diary): We only bind a key in one of the two diary integration
	methods. Closes #8359.

2007-01-26  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (Diary): Clarify that editing the diary section
	on a planner page does not affect the diary file.

2007-01-24  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	description.

2007-01-14  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	as suggested by Leo.

2007-01-14  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner.el: Make sure various planner-annotation functions show
	up in the customize interface for `planner-annotation-functions'.
	Thanks to Hadron Quark for the report.

	* planner-el.texi (Installing from a Source Archive): Mention
	creating an ~/elisp directory.  Also mention how to get Muse and
	Remember.  Mention running "make clean".
	(Installing from Arch): Document Remember archive usage.  Use "tla
	update", not "tla replay".
	(Installing from Debian): Mention remember-el.  Since I get asked
	this so frequently, mention how to make the warning message go
	away -- it's not an error!
	(Timeclock): Shift xref to end of sentence so makeinfo doesn't
	complain.
	(Getting Help): Change URL to the emacswiki.org one.  So long,
	plannerlove.  Thanks to Hadron Quark for pointing all this out.
	(Tasks): Clarify wording of `C-c C-c' explanation.

2007-01-07  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

2006-12-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-publish.el: Associate finalize function with
	:before-end, rather than :after.  That way, if Planner files are
	included in another file by means of Muse's new <include> tag,
	these transforms will still be applied.

2006-11-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-publish.el (planner-publish-note-tag): Don't call
	planner-replace-regexp-in-string if either the text or the regexp
	are empty strings.  This should fix a bug with note publishing
	that XEmacs users were experiencing.  Thanks to Cumhur Erkut for
	the report.

2006-11-04  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (PSVN): Document all options and dependencies.

2006-10-20  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* timeclock.el (timeclock-history): New.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-use-history): New.

	discrepancy to ease manual fixing.

2006-10-16  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-authz.el (planner-authz-markup-tags): Adapt for nested
	tag support.

	* planner-notes-index.el: Use add-hook instead of add-to-list, in
	case muse-publish has not been loaded yet.  Use
	muse-publish-markup-tags instead of planner-markup-tags.

	* planner-publish.el (planner-publish-markup-tags): Adapt for
	nested tag support.  Make the <nested-section> tag nestable.

	* planner-timeclock.el: Use add-hook instead of add-to-list, in
	case muse-publish has not been loaded yet.  Use
	muse-publish-markup-tags and muse-colors-markup-tags instead of
	planner-markup-tags.
	(planner-colors-timeclock-report-tag)
	(planner-publish-timeclock-report-tag): New functions created from
	planner-timeclock-report-tag.

2006-09-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner.el (planner-setup-highlighting): Don't quote
	beginning-of-line.  This should fix a bug that was noticed in
	recent Emacs 22 builds.

2006-09-23  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (Installing from Arch): Fix arch revision
	number.

2006-09-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-zoom.el (planner-zoom-iup, planner-zoom-idown)
	(planner-zoom-inext, planner-zoom-iprev): Use planner-page-name
	instead of buffer-name.  This fixes a match-string error, and
	makes things work when you have muse-file-extension set to
	something.

2006-09-04  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner.el (planner-list-tasks-with-status): Fix doc string.

2006-08-26  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	requirements and remove redundancies.
	(Notes): Update and clarify information about remember-planner.

	timeclock entry had no project name.

2006-08-12  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (.PHONY): Split long line.

	* AUTHORS: Bookkeeping.

	* contrib/schedule.el: Update header.

	* contrib/timeclock.el: Install Adrian's changes from 2006-08-01.
	Note that this version of the file is not distributed with GNU
	Emacs, but with Planner instead.

2006-08-11  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-calendar.el (planner-calendar-published-file-href): Fix
	potential error when the calendar for next month is empty.

2006-08-01  Adrian Aichner  <adrian@xemacs.org>

	* timeclock.el: Keep timeclock-file buffer around, so that an
	encrypted timeclock-file does not have to be opened on each
	clocking operation (requiring entry of encryption key).
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-get-timeclock-file-buffer): New.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log): Don't kill timeclock-file buffer.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log-data): Use
	`timeclock-get-timeclock-file-buffer', which avoids reading
	timeclock-file, if it's already in a live buffer.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-find-discrep): Ditto.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-visit-timelog): Ditto.

See ChangeLog.3 for earlier changes.
