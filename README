This directory tries to be a working configuration for emacs working
with emacs-rails mode. It is my personal config directory and it may
or may not match your preferences so modify to your heart's
consent. Such is the pleasure of Emacs.

How to install:

The files assume that they are in ~/.emacslisp and they are loaded by
linking the dot_emacs file as .emacs in your home dir. The way I have
set it up is I have two symlinks in my home dir: 
ln -s /path/to/tomtt_emacslisp ~/.emacslisp
ln -s /path/to/tomtt_emacslisp/dot_emacs ~/.emacs
